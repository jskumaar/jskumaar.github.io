<p align="justify">
Real-world behavior of pedestrians around automated vehicles is rarely studied. In a controlled setting at the Mcity test track, pedestrian interaction with automated and human-driven vehicles was examined. It was surprising to find that pedestrians trusted human-driven vehicles more than automated vehicles, even though the former drove more aggressively.
